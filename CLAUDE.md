## Project Overview

This is a **Dungeon Crawler RL Environment** - a custom Gymnasium environment implementing a grid-based dungeon crawler game optimized for tabular RL algorithms. The project is an academic assignment (20% grade weight) for a Reinforcement Learning course.

The environment features:
- **16×16 grid** with empty layout (border walls only)
- **Local vision (5×5 window)** centered on agent - partial observability
- **2 mobile enemies** with random movement (instant death on contact)
- **Simple objective**: Reach the door/exit
- **State space**: 256 states (agent position only: 16×16)
- **Three tabular RL algorithm implementations**: Q-Learning, SARSA, Expected SARSA

## Core Architecture

### State Space Design (Critical Implementation Detail)

**Simple Position-Based Encoding**: The environment uses the agent's absolute position as the primary state feature:
- **Grid**: 16×16 (single unified grid)
- **Local vision**: 5×5 window centered on agent (partial observability)
- **State encoding**: Agent position only (256 states = 16×16)

This design is implemented across two key files:
- `environment/dungeon_env.py` - operates on 16×16 grid, provides local 5×5 view
- `utils/state_encoder.py` - encodes agent position as single integer

State components:
- **Agent position**: 256 positions (16×16) - THE ONLY STATE FEATURE
- Door position: varies per episode, not included in state
- Enemy positions: 2 enemies with random movement, not included in state
- Agent has local vision only (sees 5×5 window)

**Key Design Choice**: We encode only agent position, ignoring the local view content and enemy positions. This keeps the state space very tractable (256 states) for tabular RL, while the partial observability (5×5 local vision) adds challenge to the navigation task.

### Environment Architecture (`environment/`)

**`dungeon_env.py`** (550+ lines): Main Gymnasium environment
- Implements full game loop with `reset()`, `step()`, `render()`
- 16×16 empty grid (border walls only)
- 2 mobile enemies with random movement (instant death on contact)
- Local vision: returns 5×5 window centered on agent
- Episode termination: win (reach door), lose (enemy collision), timeout (300 steps)
- Reward shaping: distance-based rewards + death penalty

**`render_pygame.py`** (480+ lines): PyGame visual renderer with camera system
- Camera system centered on agent (shows 12×12 tile viewport)
- 32×32 pixel cells for 16×16 grid
- Local vision overlay: semi-transparent blue highlight over 5×5 visible area
- Enemy sprites: red circles with angry eyes
- Agent sprite: blue circle with friendly eyes
- UI showing position, distance to door, steps, reward
- Only used when `render_mode='pygame'`

### Agent Implementations (`agents/`)

**Inheritance hierarchy**:
```
BaseTabularAgent (base_agent.py)
├── QLearningAgent (qlearning.py)
├── SARSAAgent (sarsa.py)
└── ExpectedSARSAAgent (expected_sarsa.py)
```

**`base_agent.py`** (200+ lines): Shared functionality
- Sparse Q-table storage using `defaultdict(lambda: np.zeros(n_actions))`
- Epsilon-greedy action selection
- Epsilon decay mechanism
- Save/load via pickle (Q-table + hyperparameters)

**Algorithm-specific files**: Each implements `update()` method with correct TD update rule
- **Q-Learning**: Off-policy, uses `max(Q(s', a))`
- **SARSA**: On-policy, uses `Q(s', a')` where `a'` is actual next action
- **Expected SARSA**: On-policy, uses expected value under epsilon-greedy policy

**Critical SARSA training detail**: SARSA requires selecting the next action BEFORE calling `update()`. See `train.py:205-231` for correct implementation.

### State Encoding (`utils/state_encoder.py`)

**Simple position encoding**: Agent's absolute position (y, x) in the 16×16 grid is converted to a single integer.

Example calculation:
```python
state = agent_y * 16 + agent_x  # Values from 0 to 255
```

The encoder receives:
- `local_view`: 5×5 numpy array (currently ignored for state encoding)
- `agent_pos`: absolute (y, x) position in 16×16 grid

Output: single integer state (0-255)

## Common Development Commands

### Training Agents

```bash
# Train Q-Learning agent for 5000 episodes
python train.py --algorithm qlearning --episodes 5000 --run-name qlearning_exp1

# Train SARSA with custom hyperparameters
python train.py --algorithm sarsa --episodes 5000 \
    --alpha 0.2 --gamma 0.99 --epsilon-decay 0.997 \
    --run-name sarsa_custom

# Train Expected SARSA
python train.py --algorithm expected_sarsa --episodes 5000 \
    --run-name expected_sarsa_exp1
```

**Hyperparameter defaults** (recommended for this environment):
- `--alpha 0.1` (learning rate)
- `--gamma 0.95` (discount factor)
- `--epsilon 1.0` (initial exploration)
- `--epsilon-decay 0.995` (reaches ~0.01 by episode 1000)
- `--epsilon-min 0.01` (maintains 1% exploration)

Trained models save to `models/{run_name}/` with checkpoints every 500 episodes.

### Monitoring Training

```bash
# Start TensorBoard to view training metrics
tensorboard --logdir logs/

# Open browser to http://localhost:6006
```

**Logged metrics**:
- Episode rewards, success rate, length
- Rolling 100-episode averages
- Q-table statistics (mean/max/min Q-values, num states visited)
- Epsilon decay curve

### Evaluating Agents

```bash
# Evaluate trained agent on 100 episodes
python evaluate.py --model models/qlearning_exp1/final_model.pkl --episodes 100

# Evaluate with text rendering
python evaluate.py --model models/qlearning_exp1/final_model.pkl \
    --episodes 5 --render
```

### Interactive Demo

```bash
# PyGame demo - watch trained agent play with visual rendering
python demo_pygame.py --model models/qlearning_exp1/final_model.pkl --fps 10

# Manual play mode - control the agent yourself
python demo_pygame.py --manual

# Controls: Arrow keys (move), Space (attack), R (reset), M (toggle mode), Q (quit)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test environment functionality
python -m environment.dungeon_env

# Test state encoder
python -m utils.state_encoder

# Test pygame visual rendering
python test_pygame_visual.py
```

## Key Implementation Patterns

### 1. Training Loop Structure (SARSA Special Handling)

SARSA requires selecting the next action during training to use in the update. The training loop handles this:

```python
# For SARSA: select initial action before loop
if algorithm == 'sarsa':
    action = agent.get_action(state, training=True)

while not done:
    # Non-SARSA: select action here
    if algorithm != 'sarsa':
        action = agent.get_action(state, training=True)

    # Take step
    next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)

    # SARSA: select next action for update
    if algorithm == 'sarsa' and not done:
        next_action = agent.get_action(next_state, training=True)
    else:
        next_action = None

    # Update (SARSA uses next_action, others ignore it)
    agent.update(state, action, reward, next_state, next_action)

    # Update for next iteration
    state = next_state
    if algorithm == 'sarsa':
        action = next_action  # Reuse selected action
```

### 2. Sparse Q-Table Storage

Q-tables use `defaultdict(lambda: np.zeros(n_actions))` to only store visited states. This is critical for handling the state space efficiently.

Typical memory usage:
- Theoretical states: 256
- Visited states during 5000 episodes: ~200-256 (most states get visited)
- Memory: < 1 MB per trained agent

### 3. Enemy Movement System

The 2 enemies use random movement (not deterministic patrols). Each step, each enemy randomly chooses to move UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT or STAY.

Movement logic from `dungeon_env.py`:
```python
# Random movement: 0=UP, 1=DOWN, 2=LEFT, 3=RIGHT, 4=STAY
move_action = np.random.randint(0, 5)
```

Enemy collision = instant death with -100 reward penalty. This adds danger and forces the agent to learn cautious navigation.

### 4. Reward Shaping Strategy

The environment uses **simple distance-based reward shaping** to guide learning:

| Event | Reward | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Move closer to door | +1.0 | Encourage progress toward goal |
| Move away from door | -1.0 | Discourage wrong direction |
| Step penalty | -0.1 | Encourage efficiency (always applied) |
| Reach door (WIN) | +100.0 | Ultimate goal |
| Enemy collision (DEATH) | -100.0 | Strong death penalty |

Net reward per step:
- **Moving closer**: +1.0 - 0.1 = **+0.9** (positive reinforcement)
- **Moving away**: -1.0 - 0.1 = **-1.1** (negative reinforcement)
- **Hit wall** (no movement): **-0.1** (just step penalty)

This simple reward structure encourages the agent to:
1. Navigate toward the door (positive reward for getting closer)
2. Avoid moving in wrong directions (negative reward for getting farther)
3. Avoid enemies (instant death with -100 penalty)
4. Complete episodes quickly (step penalty accumulates)

## Expected Training Performance

Typical learning progression for 5000 episodes (16×16 grid with 2 random enemies):

**Q-Learning** (off-policy, fastest):
- Episodes 0-1000: Random exploration, learning basic navigation
- Episodes 1000-3000: Learning to reach door while avoiding enemies
- Episodes 3000-5000: Refined policy with better enemy avoidance
- Expected final success: **Variable** (depends heavily on enemy randomness)

**SARSA** (on-policy, conservative):
- More cautious policy development
- Better at avoiding risky paths near enemies
- Expected final success: **May be lower due to conservative exploration**

**Expected SARSA** (hybrid approach):
- Balance between Q-Learning's speed and SARSA's safety
- Expected final success: **Variable** (somewhere between the two)

**Key Challenge**: With 2 randomly moving enemies and only local vision (5×5), success rates will be lower than a simple navigation task. The agent must learn:
1. Navigate 16×16 grid to reach door
2. Avoid randomly moving enemies (partial observability makes this harder)
3. Balance exploration vs exploitation

## Important Constraints

1. **Grid size consistency**: If changing `grid_size` in `dungeon_env.py`, also update `state_encoder.py` to match
2. **Local view size**: Currently fixed at 5×5 in both `dungeon_env.py` and `state_encoder.py`
3. **State encoding**: Current encoding uses only agent position (256 states). To include local view features, would need to redesign encoder
4. **SARSA training**: Must follow the special action selection pattern (see training loop above)
5. **Pickle compatibility**: Q-table saving converts `defaultdict` to regular dict; loading recreates `defaultdict`
6. **Enemy mechanics**: 2 enemies with random movement, instant death on contact
